# Computers, Sound, and Music Final Project â€” Spring 2020

Authors: Satvir Singh (satvir@pdx.edu) & David Hogan (davhogan@pdx.edu)

## Introduction
The purpose of the Voice Modulator is to allow a user to record their voice then playback the recording with an effect.
The available effects are: 
  * A robot voice
  * A helium effect
  * Having it sound like it is raining in the background
  * An echo effect
  * A chimpmunk effect
  * A effect to play the recording in reverse
  * A slow mo effect
  * An effect to make it sound like the user is in a public place
  
## Launch and Use
To launch the VoiceModulator ....  


To record using the VoiceModulator press the Mic button on the left.  
To finish recording hit the Stop button on the right.  
Once recording is finished press any of the effect buttons to hear the recording with the desired effect applied.  
This process can be repeated for as many recordings as the user wants, however only the most recent recording will be played.  
  
## Testing
Testing was done manually. For testing both authors would try recording at different length and then make sure all of the effects were applied correctly to the recording.  
The shortest recording tested was 1 second and the longest was one minute.
